# Angular Trading Frontend Application

### Project Description

Tech Stack: Angular, Angular Material, Angular CLI, TypeScript, CSS, HTML

The Angular Trading application is a web application for storing and managing trading accounts. The web application allows the user to manage accounts on the dashboard with functionalities of deleting, adding and viewing accounts. The user can also manage their trading funds by depositing and withdrawing funds into the account. The application also provides a daily list of trading quotes available to be viewed.

### Quick Start

The application can run from source using Angular CLI with the use of the `ng serve` command.


### Implementation

This Angular project is created with the use of various angular components such as the dashboard, trader list, and quotes.
Services were created and used for these components where necessary when trying to manipulate data using CRUD operations.
Angular Material was used by importing reusable UI components during development such as the tables in the quotes and dashboard pages.

### Test

The application was tested manually on a sample data arrays with different sets of test cases. These test cases involved CRUD operations where the application output was compared with my personal output to ensure similar results.

### Improvements

Performance can be improved with:

1. Using a back end to handle data manipulation and removing the static arrays that are currently used
2. Angular Reactive Form Module can be used during form operations
