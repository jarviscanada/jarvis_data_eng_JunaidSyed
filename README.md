# Junaid Ali Syed . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from University of Toronto with a specialization in software engineering. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with different programming technologies including C, Python, Java, React, Javascript, and databases. I also have experience with multiple internships with software development as my most recent internship where I worked in a git flow agile scrum environment. Currently, I am a Software engineer at Jarvis where I have learned and upgraded my knowledge of technologies and skills. These include core java programming, testing, deployment, fundamental programming patterns/principles, and much more. My journey of becoming a software developer has been filled with continuous learning from as early as high school. I am an individual who is enthusiastic about learning, and amazing at problem-solving. I am passionate and self-driven where my future goals aspire me to join a company to utilize my knowledge in making creative solutions that are maintainable and impactful.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JunaidSyed](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JunaidSyed)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JunaidSyed/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This Linux cluster monitor project is an agent monitoring tool that uses bash scripts to record host hardware specifications (model, architecture) and host hardware usage (memory, CPU usage). I built bash scripts that use bash commands to gather information about usage and hardware. I maintained this information by automatically recording data and inserting it into a PSQL database every minute.


## Highlighted Projects
**Hexagon Security** [[GitHub](https://github.com/junaidsyedali/hexagon-security)]: Hexagon Security is a browser-centric security tool, capable of managing a user's secure data including passwords, MFA keys, and notes. There is also a chrome extension to facilitate quick actions such as saving/autofilling passwords and adding MFA keys to their profile. I implemented CRUD operations using GraphQL mutations. I also created a secure design for handling authentication and authorization with sessions, JWT and secure key wrap algorithms.

**Byte Rewards** [[GitHub](https://github.com/junaidsyedali/bytes-rewards)]: A restaurant-oriented rewards platform with 2 web apps to support reward curation and client management alongside a static website to document development progress. I handled CRUD operations of user data in to MongoDB. I implemented logic and reward checking for the rewards system. As part of the reward checking, I implemented QR code scanning which allows owners to scan codes when handing out rewards to the users.
