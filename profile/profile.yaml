summary: "I am a recent graduate from University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with different programming technologies including C, Python, Java, React, Javascript, and databases. I also have experience with multiple internships with software development as my most recent internship where I worked in a git flow agile scrum environment. Currently, I am a Software engineer at Jarvis where I have learned and upgraded my knowledge of technologies and skills. These include core java programming, testing, deployment, fundamental programming patterns/principles, and much more. My journey of becoming a software developer has been filled with continuous learning from as early as high school. I am an individual who is enthusiastic about learning, and amazing at problem-solving. I am passionate and self-driven where my future goals aspire me to join a company to utilize my knowledge in making creative solutions that are maintainable and impactful."

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "This Linux cluster monitor project is an agent monitoring tool that uses bash scripts to record host hardware specifications (model, architecture) and host hardware usage (memory, CPU usage). I built bash scripts that use bash commands to gather information about usage and hardware. I maintained this information by automatically recording data and inserting it into a PSQL database every minute."

    description: Hexagon Security is a browser-centric security tool, capable of managing a user's secure data including passwords, MFA keys, and notes. There is also a chrome extension to facilitate quick actions such as saving/autofilling passwords and adding MFA keys to their profile. I implemented CRUD operations using GraphQL mutations. I also created a secure design for handling authentication and authorization with sessions, JWT and secure key wrap algorithms.
