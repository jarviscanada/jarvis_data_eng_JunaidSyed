summary: "I am recent graduate from University of Toronto with a specialization in software engineering. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work with different programming technologies including C, python, Java, React, javascript, relational and non-relational databases. I have applied my knowledge of these technologies with different projects which can be found on my GitHub. I also have experience with multiple internships as a QA with Ministry of Education Ontario and as a software developer with Intellijoint Surgical. My software developer position was my most recent internship as I worked in an agile scrum environment while following the Git flow branching model. My Main responsibilities included making enhancements and implementing new features to their hip surgical application tools with regular code reviews involving senior developers. Currently, I am a Software engineer at Jarvis where I have learnt and upgraded my knowledge on technologies and skills. These include core java programming, testing, deployment, fundamental programming patterns/principles and much more. My journey of becoming a software developer has been filled with continuous learning from as early as high school. I am an individual who is able to quickly adapt to the environment, enthusiastic about learning and an amazing problem solver. I am passionate and self-driven in the path that I have chosen where my future goals involve me in joining a company to utilize my knowledge in making creative solutions that are maintainable and impactful."

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "This Linux cluster monitor project is an agent monitoring tool which uses bash scripts to record host hardware specifications (model, architecture, etc) and host hardware usage (memory, cpu usage, etc). The recorded information is then stored in a PostgresSQL database. The hardware specifications are captured and stored once on installation while hardware usage is monitored every minute. This data can then be used by an infrastructure team in the future to generate reports and resource planning."
